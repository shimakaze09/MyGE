# Dependency Management Solution

Dependencies are divided into 2 categories

- My series
- Third-party

My series libraries use their own approach

Third-party libraries can be integrated in three ways

- Designate as My series libraries
- Place in MyData, use download method
- Require users to download themselves

The third method is the most complex for users and is generally offered as an optional approach (can be included or not,
gradually being replaced by simpler methods)
